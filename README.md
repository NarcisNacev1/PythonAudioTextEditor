## Python Audio Text Editor

I embarked on creating a text editor with standard features like customizable colors and fonts. However, I decided to introduce a modern twist by incorporating speech recognition, enabling users to dictate text directly into the editor.

### What I Learned

- **Library Utilization and GUI Creation**: This project introduced me to libraries such as tkinter for building the application's window and PyAudio for capturing audio input. Python's functions proved to be more straightforward compared to similar tasks in C++ or C. While exploring options for font and color customization, I opted for dictionaries, which proved efficient. Utilizing a Google API for speech recognition provided an impressive voice interpreter, simplifying user input. Creating the application window was notably simpler compared to previous projects. Adding menus with the `add_command` function was straightforward, and I discovered the utility of `lambda:` for specific function triggers upon user interaction.
