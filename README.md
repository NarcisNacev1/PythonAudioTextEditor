## Text Editor with Speech Recognition

I noticed a trend of text editors with speech recognition features in ads on my phone, so I decided to give it a shot and create one myself. It was my first time using Python libraries like tkinter and speech_recognition, which made the process quite interesting. Here's what I learned:

### What I Learned

- **Getting Started with Libraries:** Working with tkinter for GUI creation and speech_recognition for voice recognition was a new experience. Compared to my past encounters with languages like C++, Python's simplicity made things easier to grasp.
- **Customization with Fonts and Colors:** To personalize the editor, I used dictionaries for managing fonts and colors. It might not be the most advanced method, but it worked effectively for this project.
- **Voice Recognition Integration:** Utilizing a Google API for speech recognition was a highlight. It provided an efficient voice interpreter, adding a modern touch to the editor's functionality.
- **Simplified GUI Development:** Creating the application's window with tkinter was notably simpler than my previous experiences with C++ and SDL. Adding menus was straightforward using `add_command`, and I learned the utility of `lambda:` for specific function triggers upon user interaction.
